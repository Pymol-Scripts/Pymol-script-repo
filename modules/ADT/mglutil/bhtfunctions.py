# ClosePointsDist2: result and dist are empty arrays large enough to contain
# all the points expected to be found. To be safe, they should be the same
# size as the list of coordinates. This function then puts in the results
# array the indices of the close points in the list (as supplied in the array
# ids): the dist array contains the corresponding distances.
