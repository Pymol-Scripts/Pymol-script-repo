Linking APBS statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
combined work based on APBS. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
General Public License cover the whole combination.
 
SPECIAL GPL EXCEPTION
In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of APBS give you
permission to combine the APBS program with free software programs and
libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL or with code included in
releases of ISIM, Ion Simulator Interface, PMV, SMOL, VMD, and Vision. Such
combined software may be linked with APBS and redistributed together in
original or modified form as mere aggregation without requirement that the
entire work be under the scope of the GNU General Public License. This special
exception permission is also extended to any software listed in the SPECIAL GPL
EXCEPTION clauses by the PMG, FEtk, MC, or MALOC libraries.

Note that people who make modified versions of APBS are not obligated
to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is
their choice whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives
permission to release a modified version without this exception; this
exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
carries forward this exception.
