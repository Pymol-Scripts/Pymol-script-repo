## PyMOL Script Repository

This repository hosts most of the scripts and (single file) plugins from the [PyMOL Wiki](http://www.pymolwiki.org/). If you have a new script
or plugin consider place it here. There is a [Git intro](http://www.pymolwiki.org/index.php/Git_intro) page for new contributors.

The [PluginsDocs](PluginsDocs.md) file contains documentation for many of the plugins hosted here. They are summarized
by [_summarize.py](_summarize.py) command line script (not a PyMOL one).
