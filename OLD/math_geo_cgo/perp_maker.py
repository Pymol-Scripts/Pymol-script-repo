# perp_maker.py:  Creates perpendicular planes.
# =============
#
# Nothing to do with cops.  Given a simple PyMol scene, attempts to
# create a CGO background triangle perpendicular to the vector created - which is
# parallel to the line segment drawn through the camera point and current center of
# mass - as obtained by "get_position," or "get_view."
